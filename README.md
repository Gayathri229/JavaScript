# JavaScript

Notes from Akshay Saini YT channel:

_**Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.**_

single-threaded -> can execute only one command at a time.
Synchronous -> can execute commands only in a specific order [completes one line and then only goes to the other].

So, Javascript can execute only one command at a time and in a specific order.

Let's see what happens at the back of the JS code we write:

Everything in java script happens inside an Execution context. Imagine execution context as a container / a box with 2 components in it. 

It gets stored as 2 components. Variable environment(Memory) and Thread of execution(Code).

Variable environment(Memory) -> Here, the variables and functions get stored as {key: value} pairs.

Eg:
a : 10;
Fn: { ... }

Thread of execution(Code) -> Here, code gets executed one line at a time.

Eg:
.

What happens when you run a javascript code?
