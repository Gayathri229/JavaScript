Callback functions:

We can pass a function as a param to another function. The function which is passed as argument is called the callback function.

Once we pass the function as an argument, its upto that function as to when to execute it.

Callbacks help us to do asynchronous tasks in JS which is a synchronous, single-threaded language.
setTimeout is an example for callback function. The function we pass as argument for setTimeout is a callback function.

Lets take the below example.
