Undefined is a placeholder/special keyword assigned by global execution context. And it takes up memory.

Not defined occurs when memory is not allocated.

Javascript is a loosely/weakly typed language i.e. it doesn't attach its variables to any data type.

Assigning undefined to any variable by ourselves is not a good practice which can also lead to inconsistencies.
